# Crime Rates During Covid-19

### Description
When New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, issued an executive order on March 20th that mandated all non-essential workers stay home to prevent the spread of COVID-19, New York City came to a halt. As fewer people commuted to work each day, and residents only left home for groceries and essential goods, the pace of the city changed. 
Our project hypothesized this change would noticeably affect the crime rates in the city. 
We estimated a drop in overall crime and a shift in what crimes became more common. Using NYC Open data to analyze data on arrests, we asked: 
Did overall arrests increase or decrease as COVID-19 cases grew? 
What crimes saw the biggest increase and which saw the biggest decrease?
How did these changes vary?
